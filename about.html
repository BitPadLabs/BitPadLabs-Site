        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          BitPadLabs is built around a powerful mission: help real people solve real problems through clean, scalable technology, and teach the next generation how to do the same.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          BitPadLabs is a lean, modern business founded by Christopher Inman (Founding Member & CTO), Hannah Cassels, and Jaime Inman. As of 2025, Hannah and Jaime are 50/50 owners, with Chris serving as a founding member and CTO. We are now proudly operating in both Georgia and Mississippi, building useful software that makes a difference without the startup hype.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>
          We believe in human-centered design, privacy-first development, and sustainable business practices. Rather than chasing venture capital or quick exits, we're building products that stand the test of time and help people in their everyday lives.
        </p>
