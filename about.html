        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          BitPad Labs is built around a powerful mission: help real people solve real problems through clean, scalable technology—and teach the next generation how to do the same.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Founded by infrastructure and DevSecOps engineer Christopher Inman alongside his niece Hannah Cassels, BitPad Labs is a lean, modern business that avoids startup hype and focuses on value. We're a Mississippi-based LLC with a focus on creating useful software that makes a difference.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>
          We believe in human-centered design, privacy-first development, and sustainable business practices. Rather than chasing venture capital or quick exits, we're building products that stand the test of time and help people in their everyday lives.
        </p>
        
        <h3>Core Principles</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Strategic Vision over Short-Term Gains</strong> — We think in decades and execute in sprints.</li>
          <li><strong>Brand and Culture First</strong> — Our code is our craftsmanship, our UI is our storefront.</li>
          <li><strong>Solve Real Problems with Tech</strong> — No vanity projects. No tech theater.</li>
          <li><strong>Lead with Data, Design with Empathy</strong> — We build with users, not just for them.</li>
          <li><strong>Global-Ready, Local-Savvy</strong> — All BitPad products are born globally competitive.</li>
        </ul>
