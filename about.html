        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          BitPadLabs is built around a powerful mission: help real people solve real problems through clean, scalable technology, and teach the next generation how to do the same.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          BitPadLabs is a lean, modern, woman-owned small business founded by Hannah Cassels (CEO), Jaime Inman (COFO), and Melanie Amerson (CSO), who collectively serve as the company's owners and founding members. Christopher Inman (CTO) and Ryan Burke (CGO) join them as co-founders, bringing deep expertise in technology leadership, modernization, and business development.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Operating in both Georgia and Mississippi, BitPadLabs is focused on building practical, high-quality software that delivers real impact without the noise or hype.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Our Approach</h2>
        <p>
          We believe in human-centered design, privacy-first development, and sustainable business practices. Rather than chasing venture capital or quick exits, we're building products that stand the test of time and help people in their everyday lives.
        </p>
